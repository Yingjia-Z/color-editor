# Color Swatch Editor

#### Developed in HTML, CSS and Typescript.


## Features and Usage

- **Swatch Management:** Begin with 10 randomly generated color swatches. Adjust the palette by adding or removing swatches, with a limit of 1 to 16.
- **Color Adjustment:** Use interactive rectangles for precise control of hue, saturation, and luminosity. Adjustments can be made through sliders, text fields, and by clicking directly on the rectangles.
- **Multiple Color Formats:** Switch between HSL, RGB, and HEX formats to accommodate different needs. Each swatch can be edited in any of these formats.
- **Modify:** Interact with any swatch to modify its properties.
