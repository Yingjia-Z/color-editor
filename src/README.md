No improvements to consider, all requirements met :)

Note:
1. The functions in Helper.ts:
   
   hslToRgb(hue, saturation, lightness)
   rgbToHex(r, g, b)
   hexToRgb(hex)
   rgbToHsl(r, g, b)
   
   are generated by ChatGPT.
   
   I then apply a few modifications to functions' input type.

2. The method for creating gradient color in Saturation-Luminance square is referenced on the following website:
